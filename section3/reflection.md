## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- S.M.A.R.T. goals is a new goal-setting concept which I will try to follow: setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals.
- take challenges **head on** rather than trying to avoid them. This leads to faster, more concrete learning.
- **Don't** settle for half hearted efforts. Put in 100% on each project and assignment to ensure your own learning and growth.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I definitely already persist through mistakes and failure when it comes to coding: in the section 2 exercises I wrote a small adventure game called haunted_maze.rb and it was very difficult. I had many syntax errors I had to fix and even more infinite loops to end but I continued to execute the code in my terminal time and time again until it worked.
- I do _not_ learn from other peoples mistakes. I have a bad habit of tuning out of the slack channel until the day of class, or not paying attention to other's questions in class: I now realize that by doing so, I am missing out on new learning opportunities.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
